This document outlines the comprehensive updates made to the E-SERBISYO mobile application to improve user-side functionality and enhance admin-side capabilities for tracking user interactions with community events.

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Firebase Index Error**

- **Files Updated**: 
  - `services/activityService.js`
  - `services/adminService.js`

### 2. **LeaderboardScreen "Call Not a Function" Error**
- **Problem**: Missing imports for `Text` and `ActivityIndicator` components
- **Solution**: Added missing imports and safe function calls
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `screen/LeaderboardScreen.js`

### 3. **Consistent Header Across Screens**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent user information display across screens
- **Solution**: All screens now use the unified `ProfileHeader` component
